# CMSE202_Group_Project
Predicting the winners of the B1G college basketball tournament

In order to run our project there are four documents needed to download:
1.) CMSE202 Project (final1).ipynb
2.) bracket.png
3.) CMSE 202 - Sheet1.csv
4.) B1G Data.csv

The project notebooks uses these other images and files within it, and these will need to be in the same location as the notebook for it to run. Once all the files are downloaded, you can just run all the cells in the notebook (CMSE202 Project (final1).ipynb) in order.

Hailey Reese : Tested different methods on utilizing classifiers to predict the seeds of each team in the Big Ten Tournament; Created a predictor model to predict the outcome of each game in the tournament. This model was based off Kenpom's model which utilizes a team's adjusted offense and adjusted defense efficiencies.

Jacob Schmidt : Created class for visualizations and OLS analysis on coefficients 

Jennifer Abel :
